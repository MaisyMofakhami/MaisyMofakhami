# Hi, I'm Maisy ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸŒ± About Me
Iâ€™ve always enjoyed exploring both the outside world and diving into my inner thoughts. For me, finding the perfect state of flow is like a never-ending treasure hunt. I usually find myself in that sweet spot when I'm tackling a complex, multi-layered problem. That's why I love working with data; Unraveling patterns, uncovering insights, and solving challenges keep me engaged and energized.

When Iâ€™m not diving into data, youâ€™ll find me at the gym, spending time with friends, or unwinding with podcasts, movies, and series. I also love solving puzzles and practicing musicâ€”itâ€™s all part of staying curious and creative! ðŸŽµðŸ’ªðŸŽ¬ðŸ’¡
