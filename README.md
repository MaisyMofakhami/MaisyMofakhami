# Hi, I'm Maisy 👋

## 🌱 About Me
I’ve always enjoyed exploring both the outside world and diving into my inner thoughts. For me, finding the perfect state of flow is like a never-ending treasure hunt. I usually find myself in that sweet spot when I'm tackling a complex, multi-layered problem. That's why I love working with data; Unraveling patterns, uncovering insights, and solving challenges keep me engaged and energized.

When I’m not diving into data, you’ll find me at the gym, spending time with friends, or unwinding with podcasts, movies, and series. I also love solving puzzles and practicing music—it’s all part of staying curious and creative! 🎵💪🎬💡
